These exercises cover the sections of Statistics in R [Introduction to R]("introToR_Day1.html").

-- Calculate the factorial (factorial of 3 = 3+2+1) of 10 using a loop.

```{r,message=T}

for(x in 1:10){
  if(x == 1){
    factorialAnswer <- 1
  }else{
    factorialAnswer <- factorialAnswer * x 
  }
}
factorialAnswer
```
-- Adjusting your answer from before, what is the first number that has a factorial greater than 1000.
```{r,message=T}

factorialAnswer <- 0
count <- 0

while(factorialAnswer <= 1000){
  count <- count+1
  if(count == 1){
    factorialAnswer <- 1
  }else{
    factorialAnswer <- factorialAnswer * count 
  }
}
count
```

-- Using an ifelse() expression, create a factor from a vector of 1 to 40 where all numbers less than 10 are "small",10 to 30 are "mid",31 to 40 are "big"

```{r,message=T}
condExercise <- 1:40
condExercise
vectorResult <- ifelse(condExercise<10,"small",ifelse(condExercise < 31,"mid","big"))
temp <- factor(vectorResult,levels=c("small","mid","big"),order=T)
temp
```

-- loop through list and print results under different conditions.
Create a list of 100 elements each with 10 numbers drawn from a normal distribution

-- Read in right files and merge


-- loop through matrix to get medians and normalise.
-- If a gene is above a certain level do something else and write to matrix
